Some things to note:\n\u2022 New fund and instrument requested out of nowhere, for same day delivery, with an external client awaiting. This was all without having the requirements sheet for the new instrument filled out. This was not a reasonable expectation, since a fund can take anywhere from 2-14 days to get ready, tested, and deployed. It's unfathomable how this keeps happened only 2 weeks after the operations team got very clear feedback that new requirements should be given way in advance, and have known that Yehia would be off this week. The operations team claimed the Fund and Instrument were pretty simple, so it seemed feasible to implement test and deploy in a few days. This ended up only partially being the case, as some of the requirements are not supported without further work. These were not essential for the launch of the fund, so have been left for later. In summary the instrument and fund were deployed within 2 days, delaying current work around 2-5 days, and with around 3-7 days of work still pending to have the Instrument \"correct\".\n\u2022 Time off (Holiday and working hours) is not being properly respected. It would be understandable for an emergency or very urgent matter, but it seems to be a constant issue due to poor planning and communication. We have a holiday calendar in place, but this does not seem to have helped with the planning aspect. The issue is mostly on the Libre side, but regardless it does not create a good working environment for everyone, and it has involved Yehia and I directly on the Nethermind side as well."

Let's assume that once the review_date has come, and a user has not updated his documentation on time, he is added to the blocked sparse tree. This way, the user would not be able to generate a proof-of-NON-membership against this tree and he would not be able to trade. Pros: No work needs to be done, and we save one merkle proof from being proven in the ZK circuit. Cons: We need to make sure the tree is always updated (also true for other flags)."

We agreed to 2 weeks to 4 weeks with @Marek Moraczy\u0144ski and @Daniel Celeda for finalization and merge with the node. \n\nAfter this week I can tell that the merge to Nethermind process is going much smoother than I anticipated and we\u2019re at 80% done. I'm amending a few bits in Paprika to make it fully aligned with the required APIs. I believe the beginning of the next week (Mon, maybe Tue) we should have the first run over migrated Sepolia. \n\nThe process does not cover synchronization now, but the plan is to have the node synced, migrated using Paprika.Importer and then follow with having it run."
